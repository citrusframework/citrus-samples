Citrus samples ![Logo][1]
==============

Sample applications
---------

The Citrus samples applications try to demonstrate how Citrus works in
different integration test scenarios. The projects are executable with Maven
and should give you a detailed picture how Citrus testing works.

This repository uses the Java DSL and configuration in Citrus. In case you are not a Java developer you can also use the plain
XML DSL and configuration notation. The samples using XML can be found in [samples-xml][5].

Overview
---------

The Citrus samples section contains many small projects that each represents a separate system under test and
some Citrus test cases.

Each sample folder demonstrates a special aspect of how to use Citrus. Most of the samples use a simple todo-list application as
system under test. Please find following list of samples and their primary objective:

Following sample projects cover message transports and technologies. Each of these samples provides a separate system under test applicaiton
that demonstrates the messaging aspect.

Run
---------

You can run all the samples locally on your machine. We are using the Maven build tool for this.

All samples use some project as system under test. These sample application has to be started before executing any Citrus tests.
Many samples reuse the [todo-list](todo-app) application which is a simple web application that provides a basic REST API. 

You can auto start and deploy the todo-list application within the Maven build by using the following command:

     mvn clean install -Dsystem.under.test.mode=embedded
    
The embedded option automatically starts an embedded Jetty Web Server Container before the integration test phase in Maven. After that
the Citrus tests will be able to perform its actions in integration-test phase in Maven. After the tests are finished the embedded Jetty 
container is automatically stopped.

You can also start the Jetty container manually by calling:

     mvn jetty:run-war

Execute this command in the respective sample folders and you will get a running Jetty Web Server Container with the system under test deployed.

Once the sample application is deployed and running you can execute the Citrus test cases in that sample folder.
Open a separate command line terminal in that folder and execute the following command.

     mvn verify

This executes all Citrus tests in that sample. You can also pick a single test by calling 

     mvn verify -Dit.test=<testname>
    
You should see Citrus performing several tests with lots of debugging output in both terminals (sample application server
and Citrus test client). And of course green tests at the very end of the build.

Please read the instructions in each sample folder for different setup options and execution commands.
