JUnit5 sample ![Logo][1]
==============

This sample demonstrates the JUnit5 support in Citrus. We write some JUnit5 Citrus test cases that test the REST API of the todo sample application. The JUnit5 support is
also described in detail in [reference guide][4]

Objectives
---------

The [todo-list](../todo-app/README.md) sample application provides a REST API for managing todo entries.
Citrus is able to call the API methods as a client in order to validate the Http response messages.

We need a Http client component in the configuration:

```java
@Bean
public HttpClient todoClient() {
    return CitrusEndpoints
        .http()
            .client()
            .requestUrl("http://localhost:8080")
        .build();
}
```
    
In test cases we can reference this client component in order to send REST calls to the server. In JUnit5 we can use the `@ExtendsWith` annotation that loads the
`CitrusExtension` in JUnit5.
    
```java
@ExtendWith(CitrusExtension.class)
public class TodoListIT {

    @CitrusEndpoint
    private HttpClient todoClient;

    @Test
    @CitrusTest
    void testPost(@CitrusResource TestRunner runner) {
        http(action -> action.client(todoClient)
            .send()
            .post("/todolist")
            .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED_VALUE)
            .body("title=${todoName}&description=${todoDescription}"));
            
        http(action -> action.client(todoClient)
            .receive()
            .response(HttpStatus.OK));  
    }
}  
```
        
The `CitrusExtension` makes sure that Citrus framework is loaded at startup and all configuration is done properly. Then we can inject method parameters such as `@CitrusResource` annotated `TestRunner` that is
our entrance to the Citrus Java fluent API. The runner is then able to use the `httpClient` which is automatically injected via `@CitrusEndpoint` annotation as a class field member.

We can use the Citrus Java DSL fluent API in the JUnit5 test in order to exchange messages with the todo application system under test. The test is a normal JUnit5 test that is executable via Java IDE or command line using Maven or Gradle.

In order to setup Maven for JUnit5 we need to configure the `maven-failsafe-plugin` with the JUnit platform.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${maven.failsafe.plugin.version}</version>
    <configuration>
     <failIfNoTests>false</failIfNoTests>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <id>integration-tests</id>
        <goals>
          <goal>integration-test</goal>
          <goal>verify</goal>
        </goals>
      </execution>
    </executions>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-platform-surefire-provider</artifactId>
        <version>${junit.platform.version}</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
```
    
In addition to that we need the JUnit dependency in test scope in our project:

```xml
<!-- Test scoped dependencies -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
  <version>${junit.version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>    
```
       
That completes the project setup. We are now ready to execute the tests.
       
Run
---------

**NOTE:** This test depends on the [todo-app](../todo-app/) WAR which must have been installed into your local maven repository using `mvn clean install` beforehand.

The sample application uses Maven as build tool. So you can compile, package and test the
sample with Maven.
 
     mvn clean verify -Dsystem.under.test.mode=embedded
    
This executes the complete Maven build lifecycle. The embedded option automatically starts a Jetty web
container before the integration test phase. The todo-list system under test is automatically deployed in this phase.
After that the Citrus test cases are able to interact with the todo-list application in the integration test phase.

During the build you will see Citrus performing some integration tests.
After the tests are finished the embedded Jetty web container and the todo-list application are automatically stopped.

System under test
---------

The sample uses a small todo list application as system under test. The application is a web application
that you can deploy on any web container. You can find the todo-list sources [here](../todo-app). Up to now we have started an 
embedded Jetty web container with automatic deployments during the Maven build lifecycle. This approach is fantastic 
when running automated tests in a continuous build.
  
Unfortunately the Jetty server and the sample application automatically get stopped when the Maven build is finished. 
There may be times we want to test against a standalone todo-list application.  

You can start the sample todo list application in Jetty with this command.

     mvn jetty:run

This starts the Jetty web container and automatically deploys the todo list app. Point your browser to
 
    http://localhost:8080/todolist/

You will see the web UI of the todo list and add some new todo entries.

Now we are ready to execute some Citrus tests in a separate JVM.

Citrus test
---------

Once the sample application is deployed and running you can execute the Citrus test cases.
Open a separate command line terminal and navigate to the sample folder.

Execute all Citrus tests by calling

     mvn verify

You can also pick a single test by calling

     mvn verify -Dit.test=<testname>

You should see Citrus performing several tests with lots of debugging output in both terminals (sample application server
and Citrus test client). And of course green tests at the very end of the build.

Of course you can also start the Citrus tests from your favorite IDE.
Just start the Citrus test using the TestNG IDE integration in IntelliJ, Eclipse or Netbeans.
